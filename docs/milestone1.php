		<p>Purpose: I would like my personal website project to provide me with a professional looking personal website that prospective employers and clients can visit to learn about my and my capabilities.</p>
		<p>Audience: My initial audience would consist of small to medium sized business owners. Eventually I'd like to expand upon both site to include projects I've been a part of and/created and other content geared towards my professional peers. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Persona: Robert Shoemaker is an owner or manager of a web development business with a number of years of experience.</li>
				<li>Technology:He has a significant amount of expertise and knows what sites look professionally crafted and well coded.</li>
				<li>Goal:The site should be visually appealing and designed in such a way that he can learn whether or not my skills are a good fit for his company.</li>
			<li>Use Case: Looking to expand his business or find a new employee, Robert can find this site related to me, and with minimal effort be able to tell that I am a good fit for his business.</li>
		</ul>
