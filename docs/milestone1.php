		<p>Purpose: I would like my personal website project to provide me with a professional looking personal website that prospective employers and clients can visit to learn about my and my capabilities.</p>
		<p>Audience: My initial audience would consist of small to medium sized business owners. Eventually I'd like to expand upon both site to include projects I've been a part of and/created and other content geared towards my professional peers. </p>
		<p>Initially my goal would be to find full time employment that I can use to gain further experience in my chosen field. </p>
