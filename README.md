## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose is written well - you specify what you're writing the website for, and who would be the main user base. I'm assuming you're going to be using this mainly like a resume site - so think about the best way to do that as you proceed.
The Audience section is written perfectly! Not only do you clearly state the intended audience of the site - you explain what will happen in the future. Great job on this. 

Great job on your Persona and Use Case. Be sure to think about this part - "with minimal effort be able to tell that I am a good fit for his business." How will Robert be able to tell that you're a good fit? For the finished site, try your best to imagine what the business owner will be looking for, and build according to that.

Your HTML structure is good, but don't forget these two tags at the top of your document: `<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="eng">`


### Edits &amp; Suggestions 
- Include a goal in the same section as your Purpose and Audience
- Make sure you have a public_html directory in the future.



#### Overall, you did well. Only a couple of errors/missing things. You've passed milestone 1 in tier 3, and you may now advance to milestone 2a. Good job.
