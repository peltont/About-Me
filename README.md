## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose is written well - you specify what you're writing the website for, and who would be the main user base. I'm assuming you're going to be using this mainly like a resume site - so think about the best way to do that as you proceed.
The Audience section is written perfectly! Not only do you clearly state the intended audience of the site - you explain what will happen in the future. Great job on this. 

Great job on your Persona and Use Case. Be sure to think about this part - "with minimal effort be able to tell that I am a good fit for his business." How will Robert be able to tell that you're a good fit? For the finished site, try your best to imagine what the business owner will be looking for, and build according to that.

Your HTML structure is good, but don't forget these two tags at the top of your document: `<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="eng">`


### Edits &amp; Suggestions 
- Include a goal in the same section as your Purpose and Audience
- Make sure you have a public_html directory in the future.



#### Overall, you did well. Only a couple of errors/missing things. You've passed milestone 1 in tier 3, and you may now advance to milestone 2a. Good job.

Great wireframes! You've done a great job outlining both the content strategy and layout of this site. Nice work. 

Your home page is very clean and simple - make sure it also grabs the attention of the user. Add images or colors or functionality of the front page that the user can interact with and get a better sense of your skills as a web developer. 

If you have any free time at home or during the class, begin gathering images, content, and any other assets that you will use on the site. This will speed up the final development process and give you more time to style and polish the site before it is published. Also, think about color schemes, fonts, and other styling options you can use to personalize your site.

For custom fonts, I recommend using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

One of the guidelines that we have for your personal websites is that it is a single page website. I can see that you have multiple links going to other pages of your website - think of a way to compress these into one good looking page. That shouldn't be too difficult with the content you have so far. Create a good looking landing section containing the "About You" and personal image section, and then place the Past Projects and Contact section below it. 

Great use of social media sections - you wont need Email because your contact form will do that section for you. - I would use social media icons to link to your professional accounts, such as LinkedIn and Twitter (I'll link this below). You can also link your GitHub, like you have shown, and I would also suggest linking your Resume as a downloadable pdf or atleast have a pdf open in another tab.

For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward.

When you do begin development, you'll build your page on `index.php` directly inside your `/public_html` directory.


Great job with your HTML and Directory structure as well.

I noticed your last commit message is just "fix?" - while I personally believe this is a good commit message because I've made similar ones pretty often, try to avoid messages like this if you're going to link your Github to your personal website. You wouldn't want an employer seeing the work you've done and seeing the last commit message as "F*** it I give up. I'm just gonna work at Walmart."

I'm gonna say hold off on building the blog during the class. This would be a good "Week 11" project for you. Look for plugins, I'm sure there's lots of them, that way you wont have to build the blog from scratch. 



##Really nice work here. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
